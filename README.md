# Aircraft Acquisition Risk Assessment

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing aircraft acquisition risks to support strategic entry into the aviation industry. Using historical aviation data, it evaluates aircraft models based on safety records, damage resilience, operational performance, and environmental factors. The goal is to provide data-driven insights that help minimize operational risks and maximize investment value for companies considering aircraft purchases.

## Business Problem  
This project aims to help guide decision making through data driven solutions from histrorical data to ensure the right aircrafts is selected especially for new entrants into the aviation industry . The right aircraft choice may lead to lower accident risks, low maintenance and operational costs which are critical aspects for any business.
 This project addresses key questions such as:  
- Which aircraft models have the safest track records?  
- How do different models perform under adverse weather or during critical phases of flight?  
- Which aircraft are more resilient to damage in incidents?  

Answering these questions helps guide safer, smarter aircraft acquisitions that ensure operational success.

## Data Understanding  
The analysis is based on aviation incident and accident data from credible aviation safety sources.  
- **Source**: [**Dataset**] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses) 
- **Key Variables**: Aircraft make and model, number of fatal injuries, aircraft damage classification (minor, substantial, destroyed), weather conditions, and flight phase.

## Data Analysis
The project employs the following methods:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning data to handle missing values and ensure consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Identifying trends and patterns in accidents based on aircraft models, weather conditions, and phases of flight.

Visualization: Creating interactive charts and dashboards for easy visualization.

The interactive Tableau dashboard is available here:

## Recommendations
Based on the data analyzed and visualizations, the following recommendations are made for the company's entry into the aviation industry:

1. Prioritize Aircraft with Lower Incident Rates and Fatalities
Focus on purchasing aircraft models with lower total fatal injuries and fewer overall incidents. Aircraft like Maule MX-7-180 and 107.5 Flying Corporation One Design DR 107 exhibit significantly lower accident rates compared to others like Boeing 737 and Cessna 152, making them safer choices for commercial and private operations. Selecting aircraft with proven safety records will minimize risk exposure and improve operational reliability.

2. Choose Aircraft with Higher Resilience to Damage
Select aircraft models that tend to sustain minor damage more often than substantial or destroyed damage, such as Boeing Stearman E75 and Cessna Ector 3059. This suggests better resilience in the event of an incident. Aircraft like the Maule MX-7-180, which show higher proportions of minor damage, indicate better durability and lower long-term repair costs, making them ideal for both safety and cost-efficiency in operations.

3. Monitor Aircraft Performance by Weather and Flight Phases
Given that weather conditions and phases of flight significantly influence accident rates, prioritize aircraft that perform well under various conditions. Aircraft models associated with lower accident rates during adverse weather or critical phases (takeoff and landing) should be prioritized. For example, models like Cessna 172 that show resilience in varying weather conditions should be considered, while aircraft types with higher accident frequencies in challenging conditions should be avoided. This approach will help ensure safer operations across a wide range of environments and operational conditions.
